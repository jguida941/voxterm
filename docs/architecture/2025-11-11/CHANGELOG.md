# Daily Changelog — 2025-11-11

## Added
- Captured the original Codex Voice architecture overview (Python MVP + Rust TUI pipeline) within the new dated folder structure.

## Notes
- This entry retroactively documents the pre-existing design (captured on 2025-11-11) so all future architecture references live under `docs/architecture/YYYY-MM-DD/`.
