# Documentation Audit — 2025-11-12

Objective: inventory every DOC/markdown artifact in the repo, flag accuracy gaps, and map each file to the organizational rules defined in `agents.md` (daily architecture folders only, root index + overview, guides/audits segregated).

## 1. Root-Level Documents

| File | Current Content Snapshot | Status vs. SDLC Rules | Recommended Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `agents.md` | Governance + workflow instructions (recently updated) | ✅ Current | None. Keep as primary policy. |
| `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` | Mission + focus + links to dated folders | ✅ Current | Update whenever latest daily folder changes. |
| `master_index.md` | Directory map + daily checklist | ✅ Current | Enforce checklist (especially “no stray architecture files”). |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Only 2025-11-12 entry (governance setup) | ⚠️ Needs ongoing updates | Append on every change per SDLC. |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Large “Architecture & Operations Guide” duplicating older pipeline details (mentions Python fallback focus, outdated CLI flags) | ❌ Violates new policy (architecture must live under `docs/architecture/YYYY-MM-DD/`; content is stale) | Move content into a dated folder (e.g., new 2025-11-12 supplement) or reframe as a guide under `docs/guides/`. Remove root copy afterward. |
| `MASTER_DOC.md` | Legacy master doc referencing obsolete directories (`docs/README.md`, `docs/chatgpt.md`), claims PTY streaming “in progress” | ⚠️ Partially outdated and conflicts with new nav plan | Either: (a) migrate to `docs/guides/legacy_master_doc.md` and mark as historical, or (b) refresh to match current architecture, then link via `master_index.md`. Root ideally should only keep `agents`, `PROJECT_OVERVIEW`, `master_index`, `CHANGELOG`. |
| `chatgptauditnov12.md` | This audit log | ✅ New | Keep under root (audits can also live in `docs/audits/` if preferred). |

## 2. `docs/` Tree

### 2.1 `docs/architecture/`
- `2024-01-01/` — Retrofitted legacy overview (✅). No further action unless more historical notes exist.
- `2025-11-12/` — Governance + consolidation notes (✅). Becomes “previous day” once a new folder is added.
- **Missing:** 2024-2025 daily coverage between those dates. If major decisions occurred, backfill relevant days.

### 2.2 `docs/guides/`
- `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` — Accurate instructions for Python + Rust flows (last reviewed today). Keep updated when workflows change.
- `HOW_TO_TEST_AUDIO.md` — Documents sample-rate fix tests (mostly Python/early Rust). Needs a note explaining current resampler location + test binaries, or mark as “legacy audio test” under `docs/archive/` if no longer relevant.
- **Opportunity:** Move `ARCHITECTURE.md` & `MASTER_DOC.md` content here once modernized (e.g., `docs/guides/architecture_overview.md`, `docs/guides/master_doc.md`).

### 2.3 `docs/audits/`
- `claudeaudit.md` — November audit (✅). Keep here; add future audits with date prefixes for clarity (e.g., `2025-11-10-claude.md`). Consider moving this file name to include the date explicitly.

### 2.4 `docs/plan.md`
- Describes the original multi-phase roadmap (Python MVP → Rust TUI). Still valuable historically but belongs either in `docs/architecture/2024-01-01/` as supporting material or `docs/archive/`.

### 2.5 `docs/archive/`
- Already houses old reference material. Use it for superseded guides (`MASTER_DOC`, old plans) once migrated.

## 3. Consolidation Plan (per `agents.md`)

1. **Eliminate Root Architecture Docs**
   - Move `ARCHITECTURE.md` content into a new dated folder (`docs/architecture/2025-11-12/` addendum or `2025-11-13/` when created) or convert to `docs/guides/architecture_overview.md`.
   - Update `master_index.md` + `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` to link to the new location; delete the root file afterward.

2. **Normalize Master Document**
   - Decide whether `MASTER_DOC.md` is a living guide or historical reference. Options:
     - Refresh and relocate to `docs/guides/master_doc.md`, linking from `master_index.md`.
     - If obsolete, move to `docs/archive/` and add a note pointing to `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` as the canonical entry point.

3. **Plan & Legacy Docs**
   - Fold `docs/plan.md` into the dated architecture folder that corresponds to when the plan was approved (likely `2024-01-01/PLAN.md`) or relocate to `docs/archive/plan.md`.
   - Ensure `docs/guides/HOW_TO_TEST_AUDIO.md` references the current Rust test binaries; if not, add an “Updated: 2025-11-12” section or move to archive.

4. **Navigation & CI**
   - Extend CI to fail when root contains unauthorized `.md` files (anything other than `agents.md`, `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`, `master_index.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `chatgptaudit*.md`).
   - Add lint scripts ensuring each PR updates: (a) repo `CHANGELOG.md`, (b) current day’s `docs/architecture/YYYY-MM-DD/`, and (c) root index pointers if new folders appear.

5. **Weekly/Monthly Index (Optional)**
   - To avoid overwhelming daily folders, create `docs/architecture/index.md` or `docs/architecture/2025-11-weekly.md` summarizing that week’s decisions. Mention this practice in `agents.md` once formalized.

## 4. Action Items Summary

| Priority | Task | Owner Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Migrate root `ARCHITECTURE.md` into dated folder or guide; remove root copy | Aligns with new “daily folder only” rule |
| P0 | Decide fate of `MASTER_DOC.md` (modernize + move or archive) | Prevents conflicting root entry points |
| P1 | Relocate `docs/plan.md` + annotate guides (`HOW_TO_TEST_AUDIO`, etc.) with current status | Keeps docs accurate |
| P1 | Add CI/doc-lint checks for daily folder + changelog updates, and for unauthorized root docs | Enforces `agents.md` rules |
| P2 | Backfill missing architecture days between 2024-01-02 and 2025-11-11 for major milestones | Ensures full traceability |
| P2 | Introduce weekly/monthly architecture summaries once daily cadence proves heavy | Optional but recommended for scale |

Document prepared on 2025-11-12 to guide the next reorganization steps. Use this audit as the reference when implementing the remaining cleanups. Once tasks complete, archive this audit under `docs/audits/2025-11-12-chatgpt.md` for posterity.
