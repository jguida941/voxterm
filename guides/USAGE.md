# Usage Guide

This guide explains how to use VoiceTerm for hands-free coding with the Codex CLI
or Claude Code. Experimental presets exist for Gemini, Aider, and OpenCode, but
Gemini is currently nonfunctional and Aider/OpenCode are untested.

## Quick Start

**Already installed?** Here's how to start talking to the CLI:

1. **Launch**: Run `voiceterm` in your project folder
2. **Speak**: Press `Ctrl+R`, say your request, then pause
3. **Done**: VoiceTerm types your words into the terminal for you. In auto mode
   it also presses Enter; in insert mode you press `Enter` yourself when ready.

That's it! Read on for more control over how voice input works.

**Backend note:** By default, `voiceterm` launches the Codex CLI.
To use Claude Code:
- `voiceterm --claude`

If you have not logged in yet:
- `voiceterm --login --codex`
- `voiceterm --login --claude`

Experimental presets (untested):
- `voiceterm --gemini` (currently not working)
- `voiceterm --backend aider`
- `voiceterm --backend opencode`

## How Voice Input Works

VoiceTerm turns your voice into keystrokes. It does **not** talk to any AI
directly - it just types into the terminal, exactly like you would.

1. **Record** - you speak, VoiceTerm listens until you stop
2. **Transcribe** - Whisper converts speech to text locally (nothing leaves your machine)
3. **Expand (optional)** - if `.voiceterm/macros.yaml` matches your transcript trigger, VoiceTerm expands it first
4. **Type** - the final text is typed into the terminal automatically

That's it. The only difference between the two send modes is what happens
after the text is typed:

- **Auto** - VoiceTerm also presses Enter, so the CLI processes it right away
- **Insert** - the text appears on the command line and you press `Enter`
  yourself (handy if you want to review or edit first)

UI label note: the HUD/Settings shortcut for insert behavior is shown as
`edit` to make the "review before Enter" behavior explicit.

You control **when** recording starts and **what happens** after transcription.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

All shortcuts in one place:

| Key | What it does |
|-----|--------------|
| `Ctrl+R` | **Record** - Start voice capture (manual mode) |
| `Ctrl+V` | **Voice toggle** - Turn auto-voice on/off |
| `Ctrl+T` | **Typing mode** - Switch between auto-send and edit mode (insert behavior) |
| `Ctrl+Y` | **Theme picker** - Choose a status line theme |
| `Ctrl+O` | **Settings** - Open the settings menu (use ↑↓←→ + Enter) |
| `Ctrl+U` | **HUD style** - Cycle Full → Minimal → Hidden |
| `Ctrl+]` | **Threshold up** - Make mic less sensitive (+5 dB) |
| `Ctrl+\` | **Threshold down** - Make mic more sensitive (-5 dB) |
| `?` | **Help** - Show shortcut help overlay |
| `Enter` | **Send/Stop** - In edit mode: stop recording early, or press `Enter` to send typed text |
| `Ctrl+C` | Forward interrupt to CLI |
| `Ctrl+Q` | **Quit** - Exit the overlay |

**Tip**: `Ctrl+/` also works for decreasing threshold (same as `Ctrl+\`).
Use **Left/Right** to move HUD button focus and **Enter** to activate the focused button.

---

## Settings Menu

Press `Ctrl+O` to open the settings overlay.
Navigate with **↑/↓**, adjust values with **←/→**, and press **Enter** to toggle
or activate the selected row. `Esc` closes the menu.

![Settings Menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jguida941/voiceterm/master/img/settings.png)

The menu surfaces the most common controls (auto-voice, send mode,
macros, mic sensitivity, theme, latency display) plus backend and pipeline
info.

It also lets you configure:
- **HUD style**: Full, Minimal, or Hidden
- **HUD borders**: Theme, Single, Rounded, Double, Heavy, or None (Full HUD)
- **Right-side panel**: Off, Ribbon, Dots, Heartbeat (shown in Full and Minimal HUD)
- **Anim only**: Animate the right panel only while recording
- **Latency display**: Off, `Nms`, or `Latency: Nms` (shortcuts row)
- **Mouse**: Toggle HUD button clicks (on by default)

When Mouse is enabled, you can click HUD buttons and overlay controls.
Left/Right selects a HUD button and Enter activates it (even if Mouse is OFF).

---

## Voice Modes

Three controls shape voice behavior:

- **Auto-voice** (`Ctrl+V`) - when ON, VoiceTerm listens automatically. When OFF, you press `Ctrl+R` each time.
- **Send mode** (`Ctrl+T`) - **auto** types your words and presses Enter. **Insert** types your words but lets you press Enter yourself.
- **Macros** (Settings -> Macros) - **ON** applies `.voiceterm/macros.yaml` expansions before injection. **OFF** injects raw transcripts.

### Auto-voice × send mode combinations

| Auto-voice | Send mode | How it works |
|------------|-----------|--------------|
| Off | Auto | You press `Ctrl+R` to record. Text is typed + Enter is pressed for you. |
| Off | Insert | You press `Ctrl+R` to record. Text is typed. You press `Enter` when ready. |
| On | Auto | Just start talking. Text is typed + Enter is pressed for you. |
| On | Insert | Just start talking. Text is typed. You press `Enter` when ready. |

Macros toggle is orthogonal to this table:
- **ON**: macros can expand transcripts before injection.
- **OFF**: raw transcript is injected as-is.

### Tips

- **Enter during recording** (insert mode): stops recording early so it
  transcribes faster. Press `Enter` again to send.
- **Auto-voice ON** keeps listening after each transcript - you never need
  to press `Ctrl+R`.
- **When the CLI is busy**: VoiceTerm waits, then types when the prompt returns.
- **Prompt detection**: if auto-voice doesn't re-trigger after the CLI
  finishes, it falls back to an idle timer. Set `--prompt-regex` if your
  prompt is unusual (especially with Claude).

### Long dictation (auto-voice + insert)

Each recording chunk is 30 seconds by default (max 60s via
`--voice-max-capture-ms`). With auto-voice + insert mode you can speak
continuously - each chunk is transcribed and typed, and auto-voice
immediately starts a new recording. Press `Enter` when you're done to send
everything.

## Common Tasks

### Adjust microphone sensitivity

If the mic picks up too much background noise or misses your voice:

- `Ctrl+]` - Less sensitive (raise threshold, ignore quiet sounds)
- `Ctrl+\` - More sensitive (lower threshold, pick up quieter sounds)

The status line shows the current threshold (e.g., "Mic sensitivity: -35 dB").
Hotkey range: -80 dB (very sensitive) to -10 dB (less sensitive). Default: -55 dB.
The CLI flag accepts a wider range (-120 dB to 0 dB).

**Tip**: Run `voiceterm --mic-meter` to measure your environment and get a suggested threshold.

### Check which audio device is being used

```bash
voiceterm --list-input-devices
```

To use a specific device:
```bash
voiceterm --input-device "MacBook Pro Microphone"
```

### Run diagnostics

```bash
voiceterm --doctor
```

### Tune auto-voice timing

```bash
# Idle time before auto-voice starts listening
voiceterm --auto-voice-idle-ms 1200

# Idle time before queued transcripts flush
voiceterm --transcript-idle-ms 250
```

### Tune startup splash timing

```bash
# Keep splash but clear immediately
VOICETERM_STARTUP_SPLASH_MS=0 voiceterm

# Keep splash longer/shorter (milliseconds, max 30000)
VOICETERM_STARTUP_SPLASH_MS=900 voiceterm

# Disable splash entirely
VOICETERM_NO_STARTUP_BANNER=1 voiceterm
```

### Notification sounds

```bash
# Enable all sounds
voiceterm --sounds

# Only completion or error beeps
voiceterm --sound-on-complete
voiceterm --sound-on-error
```

---

## Project Voice Macros

You can define project-local voice triggers in `.voiceterm/macros.yaml`.
VoiceTerm loads this file from your current working directory and expands
matching transcripts before typing into the CLI.

Example:

```yaml
macros:
  run tests: cargo test --all-features
  commit with message:
    template: "git commit -m '{TRANSCRIPT}'"
    mode: insert
```

Rules:
- Trigger matching is case-insensitive and ignores repeated spaces.
- Template macros can consume extra spoken words via `{TRANSCRIPT}`.
- `mode` is optional and can be `auto` or `insert`.
- Macros are applied only when **Settings -> Macros = ON**.

---

## Understanding the Status Line

The bottom of your terminal shows the current state:

Example layout:
`◉ AUTO │ -35dB │ Auto-voice enabled   Ctrl+R rec  Ctrl+V auto`

Sections (left to right):
- Mode indicator (auto/manual/idle)
- Mic sensitivity in dB
- Status message (recording adds a live waveform + dB readout)
- Shortcut hints (on wide terminals)
- Optional right-side panel (Ribbon / Dots / Heartbeat) if enabled in Settings
- Compact telemetry chips (latency trend, queue, meter) that adapt to width/state

Latency badge behavior:
- When available, latency is shown as post-capture processing time (mainly STT).
- Recording duration while you speak is shown separately.
- If latency metrics are incomplete, VoiceTerm hides the latency badge rather than
  showing an unreliable value.

When recording or processing, the mode label includes a pipeline tag
(e.g., `REC R` or `… PY`).

Visual updates:
- VoiceTerm keeps bounded telemetry history for meter/latency and renders sparkline-style trends in compact HUD space.
- Full HUD rendering uses a conservative writer path and clears stale HUD rows on resize to avoid duplicated/ghost rows in IDE terminals.
- JetBrains IDE terminals auto-skip the startup splash to avoid alternate-screen handoff artifacts.
- Compact HUD modules adapt by context:
  - recording: meter + latency + queue (space permitting)
  - backend busy: queue + latency
  - idle: latency-focused minimal telemetry

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Auto-voice enabled` | Listening will start when the CLI is ready |
| `Listening Manual Mode (Rust)` | Recording now (you pressed Ctrl+R) |
| `Processing …` | Transcribing your speech (spinner updates) |
| `Transcript ready (Rust)` | Text typed into the terminal (auto mode also presses Enter) |
| `Transcript ready (Rust, macro 'run tests')` | A voice macro trigger matched and expanded before injection |
| `Macros: OFF` | Macro expansion disabled; transcripts are injected unchanged |
| `No speech detected` | Recording finished but no voice was heard |
| `Transcript queued (2)` | 2 transcripts waiting for the CLI to be ready |
| `Mic sensitivity: -35 dB` | Threshold changed |

"Rust" means fast native transcription. "Python" means fallback mode (slower but more compatible).

### Themes

Press `Ctrl+Y` to open the theme picker:

![Theme Picker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jguida941/voiceterm/master/img/theme-picker.png)

Use ↑/↓ to move and Enter to select, or type the theme number.
With Mouse enabled (on by default), click a theme row to select it and click [×]
close to exit.

Available themes:
- `chatgpt`
- `claude`
- `codex`
- `coral`
- `catppuccin`
- `dracula`
- `nord`
- `tokyonight`
- `gruvbox`
- `ansi` (16-color)
- `none`

Theme tips:
- `voiceterm --theme catppuccin` to start with a specific theme.
- If `--theme` is not set, VoiceTerm picks a backend default (Claude → `claude`,
  Codex → `codex`, others → `coral`).
- `voiceterm --no-color` or `NO_COLOR=1` to disable colors entirely.

### HUD Styles

For users who prefer less UI clutter, VoiceTerm offers three HUD styles:

| Style | Flag | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Full** | (default) | 4-row banner with borders, shortcuts, and detailed info |
| **Minimal** | `--hud-style minimal` or `--minimal-hud` | Single-line strip |
| **Hidden** | `--hud-style hidden` | `VoiceTerm` launcher row with `Ctrl+U` hint when idle; shows dim `REC` while recording |

Examples of the Minimal strip: `◉ AUTO · Ready`, `● REC · -55dB`.
Full HUD border style is configurable via `--hud-border-style`:
`theme`, `single`, `rounded`, `double`, `heavy`, `none`.
In Full HUD, status text (for example `Ready`) remains visible even with a
right-panel visualization enabled.
In Full HUD idle state, VoiceTerm uses concise labels for visual stability:
- manual mode label is shown as `PTT`
- success/info idle messages collapse to `Ready`
- queued state is shown in the shortcuts row badge (`Q:n`) without repeating
  `Transcript queued (...)` in the main row
- right-panel Ribbon mode uses a wider waveform budget in Full HUD for better
  readability on wide terminals
- Full HUD keeps steady-state `Ready` near the dB lane in the main row.
- Full HUD keeps latency in the lower shortcuts row with selectable styles:
  `Off`, `Nms`, or `Latency: Nms`.
- Main-row status text lane (after dB) is used for transient/toggle messages
  (for example send-mode changes).
- During active recording/processing, duplicate state words are suppressed in
  the main-row status lane so `REC`/`processing` is not shown twice.

When Mouse is enabled, Minimal HUD shows a [back] button on the right to return
to Full. If a right-panel mode is enabled, Minimal HUD also shows a compact
telemetry visualization chip (`Ribbon`, `Dots`, or `Heartbeat`).
Idle status text in Minimal HUD is intentionally compact to keep layout stable:
`Ready`, `Queued N`, `Warning`, or `Error`.

Minimal HUD (recording example):

![Minimal HUD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jguida941/voiceterm/master/img/minimal-hud.png)

Hidden HUD (idle example):

![Hidden HUD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jguida941/voiceterm/master/img/hidden-hud.png)

```bash
# Minimal HUD - just a colored mode indicator
voiceterm --minimal-hud

# Hidden HUD - launcher row while idle, dim REC indicator while recording
voiceterm --hud-style hidden

# Full HUD without a border frame
voiceterm --hud-style full --hud-border-style none

# Disable right-side waveform/pulse panel
voiceterm --hud-right-panel off
```

You can also change HUD style at runtime via the settings menu (`Ctrl+O`).

Preview tips:
- When a transcript completes, a short preview snippet appears in quotes for a few seconds.
- During recording, the status line shows a live waveform and the current dB level.
- The live dB display is clamped to a `-60dB` floor to avoid misleading extreme values.
- While backend output is streaming, HUD/settings interactions should remain responsive on current builds.
