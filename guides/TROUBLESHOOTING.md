## Status Messages

### No speech detected

The mic recorded but no voice was heard above the threshold.

**Fixes:**
1. Speak louder or closer to the mic
2. Lower the threshold: press `Ctrl+\` (or `Ctrl+/`) to make it more sensitive
3. Run `voxterm --mic-meter` to calibrate for your environment

### Voice capture failed (see log)

You may also see "Voice capture error (see log)" - use the same fixes below.

The mic couldn't start recording.

**Fixes:**
1. Check mic permissions for your terminal app
2. Run `voxterm --list-input-devices` to see available mics
3. Try a specific device: `voxterm --input-device "Your Mic Name"`
4. Enable logs to see details: `voxterm --logs`

### Voice capture error (see log)

Something went wrong during recording or transcription.

**Fixes:**
1. Enable logs: `voxterm --logs`
2. Check the log at `${TMPDIR}/voxterm_tui.log`
3. Restart `voxterm`

### Processing... (stuck)

Transcription is taking too long.

**Fixes:**
1. Wait up to 60 seconds (large audio takes time)
2. If still stuck, press `Ctrl+C` then restart `voxterm`
3. Try a smaller Whisper model

### Transcript queued (N)

The CLI is still streaming output, so VoxTerm queued your transcript.
It will inject into the terminal when the next prompt appears (or after output
is idle for the transcript timeout). In auto mode, Enter is pressed for you.

**Fixes:**
1. Wait for the CLI to finish and return to a prompt
2. If you need to send immediately, stop the current response (usually `Ctrl+C`) and try again

### Transcript stays queued in Claude review prompts

Some Claude sessions show confirmation prompts (for example `[Y/n]`) instead of
a bare `>` line. Older builds could miss these as "ready" and keep transcripts
queued until idle timeout.

**Fixes:**
1. Upgrade to the latest VoxTerm build
2. Restart the session after upgrading
3. If needed, set an explicit prompt regex (example: `--prompt-regex '.*\\[[Yy]/[Nn]\\]\\s*$'`)

### Voice macro not expanding

VoxTerm loads macros from `.voxterm/macros.yaml` in your current working
directory. If the file is missing, malformed, or the trigger does not match,
the transcript is sent as-is.

**Fixes:**
1. Confirm path: `<project>/.voxterm/macros.yaml`
2. Validate YAML shape:
   - `macros:`
   - trigger as key, string expansion or `{ template: ..., mode: auto|insert }`
3. Match trigger text exactly (case-insensitive, whitespace-insensitive)
4. Restart VoxTerm after editing the macro file

### Voice macro expanded when dictating prose

Macro expansion is enabled only in **Voice mode: Command**.
If you are dictating natural language, switch to **Voice mode: Dictation** in
Settings (`Ctrl+O`), which bypasses macro expansion.

**Fixes:**
1. Open Settings (`Ctrl+O`)
2. Set **Voice mode** to **Dictation**
3. Keep your preferred send mode (`auto` or `insert`) unchanged

### Auto-voice re-arms before transcript review is done

If you use auto-voice and want to edit each transcript before sending, default
auto behavior can restart listening while you are still editing.

**Fixes:**
1. Open Settings (`Ctrl+O`)
2. Turn **Review first** to **ON**
3. Speak, edit the injected text, then press `Enter` to send and re-arm auto-voice

### Review mode indicator does not match settings

With **Review first** ON, status/HUD should include `RVW` and the send control
label should read `review`.

**Fixes:**
1. Toggle **Review first** OFF and back ON in Settings (`Ctrl+O`)
2. Confirm you are running the latest build (`voxterm --version`)
3. Restart `voxterm` if the old HUD state persists

### Typing/Enter feels laggy while backend is thinking

On older builds, PTY write backpressure could briefly stall keyboard injection
while the backend was streaming output.

**Fixes:**
1. Upgrade to the latest VoxTerm build
2. Restart the session after upgrading
3. If it still reproduces, run with logs (`voxterm --logs`) and capture a short sample around the lag window

### HUD/overlay overlaps after terminal resize

On older builds, a resize edge case could leave a stale terminal scroll region
active after HUD reservation changed, causing bottom-row overlap artifacts.

**Fixes:**
1. Upgrade to the latest VoxTerm build
2. Resize once more (or restart session) after upgrading to clear stale state

### REC timer or dB meter appears frozen while queued

If the backend is producing continuous output, older builds could pause HUD timer
updates while a queued transcript was pending.

**Fixes:**
1. Upgrade to the latest VoxTerm build
2. Restart the session after upgrading

### Latency badge looks inaccurate

The HUD latency badge represents post-capture processing time (mainly STT), not
the full time you spent talking. Recording duration is shown separately while
you are speaking.

If VoxTerm does not have enough metrics to estimate latency reliably, the badge
is hidden instead of showing a misleading number.

**Audit steps:**
1. Run with logs enabled: `voxterm --logs`
2. Reproduce one recording and inspect `${TMPDIR}/voxterm_tui.log`
3. Look for `latency_audit|display_ms=...|elapsed_ms=...|capture_ms=...|stt_ms=...`
4. For deeper profiling, run `./dev/scripts/tests/measure_latency.sh --voice-only --synthetic`

### Transcript queue full (oldest dropped)

You spoke 5+ times while Codex was busy. The oldest transcript was discarded.

**Fix:** Wait for Codex to finish before speaking again. The queue holds up to 5 transcripts.

### Voice capture already running

You pressed `Ctrl+R` while already recording.

**Fix:** Wait for the current recording to finish, or enable auto-voice
(`Ctrl+V`) so you don't need to press `Ctrl+R`.

### Python pipeline

Native Whisper isn't available, using slower Python fallback.

**Fixes:**
1. Verify model exists: `ls whisper_models/ggml-*.bin`
2. Download model: `./scripts/setup.sh models --base`
3. Or install Python dependencies: `python3`, `ffmpeg`, `whisper` CLI

## Audio Setup

### Check microphone permissions

**macOS:** System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone → Enable for your
terminal app (Terminal, iTerm2, etc.)

**Linux:** Ensure your user has access to PulseAudio/PipeWire. Check with `pactl list sources`.

### Verify Whisper model exists

```bash
ls whisper_models/ggml-*.bin
```

If missing:
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh models --base
```

### List and select audio devices

```bash
voxterm --list-input-devices
```

Use a specific device:
```bash
voxterm --input-device "MacBook Pro Microphone"
```

### Microphone changed or unplugged

Restart `voxterm` after plugging in a new mic. Devices are detected at startup.

---

## Mic Sensitivity

### Too sensitive (picks up background noise)

Press `Ctrl+]` to raise the threshold (less sensitive).
Repeat until background noise stops triggering recordings.

Or set it at startup:
```bash
voxterm --voice-vad-threshold-db -30
```

### Not sensitive enough (misses your voice)

Press `Ctrl+\` (or `Ctrl+/`) to lower the threshold (more sensitive).

Or set it at startup:
```bash
voxterm --voice-vad-threshold-db -50
```

### Find the right threshold

Run the mic meter to measure your environment:
```bash
voxterm --mic-meter
```

It samples ambient noise and your speech, then suggests a threshold.

**Hotkey range:** -80 dB (very sensitive) to -10 dB (less sensitive). Default: -55 dB.
The CLI flag accepts a wider range (-120 dB to 0 dB).

---

## Codex Issues

If you're using Claude Code, substitute `claude` wherever you see `codex` below.

### Codex not responding

1. Verify Codex CLI is installed:
   ```bash
   which codex
   ```

2. Check authentication:
   ```bash
   codex login
   ```
   Or run:
   ```bash
   voxterm --login --codex
   voxterm --login --claude
   ```

3. If the session is stuck, restart `voxterm`.

---

### Auto-voice not triggering

Auto-voice waits for the CLI to show a prompt before listening.
If detection fails (especially on Claude with a custom prompt):

#### Override prompt detection

```bash
voxterm --prompt-regex '^codex> $'
```

Adjust the regex to match your actual prompt.

#### Enable prompt logging

```bash
voxterm --prompt-log /tmp/voxterm_prompt.log
```

Check the log to see what lines are being detected.

---

## Install Issues

### Homebrew link conflict

If `brew install voxterm` fails because the command already exists:

```bash
brew link --overwrite voxterm
```

### Wrong version after update

Start with a normal update:
```bash
brew update
brew upgrade voxterm
```

If Homebrew still shows the old version, force a tap refresh:
```bash
brew untap jguida941/voxterm 2>/dev/null || true
brew untap jguida941/homebrew-voxterm 2>/dev/null || true
brew tap jguida941/voxterm
brew update
brew info voxterm
```

If it still will not update, clear the cache and reinstall:
```bash
rm -f "$(brew --cache)"/voxterm--*
brew reinstall voxterm
```

If `voxterm --version` still looks old, check for duplicate installs earlier in PATH:
```bash
which -a voxterm
```

Remove or rename the old one (often `~/.local/bin/voxterm` from `./scripts/install.sh`):
```bash
mv ~/.local/bin/voxterm ~/.local/bin/voxterm.bak
hash -r
```

If you used a local install previously, also check for:
```bash
ls -l ~/voxterm/bin/voxterm 2>/dev/null
```

Relink Homebrew and clear shell caches:
```bash
brew unlink voxterm && brew link --overwrite voxterm
hash -r
```

Verify the Homebrew binary directly (bypasses the wrapper):
```bash
$(brew --prefix)/opt/voxterm/libexec/src/target/release/voxterm --version
```

## IDE Terminal Controls Not Working (JetBrains/Cursor)

If HUD button clicks or arrow-based HUD focus works in one terminal app but not
another (for example RustRover/PyCharm/WebStorm):

1. Upgrade to the latest VoxTerm build.
2. Toggle the HUD with `Ctrl+U` and open Settings with `Ctrl+O` to confirm core
   shortcuts still work.
3. Capture input diagnostics:
   ```bash
   voxterm --logs
   VOXTERM_DEBUG_INPUT=1 voxterm --logs
   ```
4. Reproduce one failed click/arrow action and inspect `${TMPDIR}/voxterm_tui.log`
   for `input bytes (...)` and `input events: ...` lines.

VoxTerm now parses multiple mouse/arrow sequence variants used by different IDE
terminal emulators (SGR, URXVT, X10, and parameterized CSI arrows), but the
debug log above is still the fastest way to confirm what your terminal emits.

---

## Startup Banner Missing

The startup splash is shown by default. If it does not appear, confirm the
environment variable below is not set:

```bash
env | rg VOXTERM_NO_STARTUP_BANNER
```

To explicitly hide it (useful in scripts), set:

```bash
VOXTERM_NO_STARTUP_BANNER=1 voxterm
```

---

## Enabling Logs

Logs are disabled by default for privacy.

### Enable debug logging

```bash
voxterm --logs
```

### Include transcript snippets in logs

```bash
voxterm --logs --log-content
```

### Log file location

Debug log: system temp dir (for example `${TMPDIR}/voxterm_tui.log` on macOS or
`/tmp/voxterm_tui.log` on Linux)

Trace log (JSON, written when `--logs` is enabled): system temp dir (for example
`${TMPDIR}/voxterm_trace.jsonl` on macOS or `/tmp/voxterm_trace.jsonl` on Linux).
Override with `VOXTERM_TRACE_LOG`.

Crash log (panic only, written when `--logs` is enabled; metadata unless
`--log-content`): system temp dir (for example `${TMPDIR}/voxterm_crash.log`
on macOS or `/tmp/voxterm_crash.log` on Linux)

### Disable all logging

```bash
voxterm --no-logs
```

## FAQ

### What languages does Whisper support?

Whisper supports many languages. VoxTerm has been tested with English (`en`).

Other languages should work but are untested. Use `--lang auto` for automatic
detection, or specify a language code: `voxterm --lang es`

Full list: [Whisper supported languages](https://github.com/openai/whisper#available-models-and-languages)

### Which AI CLI backends work?

Only Codex and Claude Code are tested. Other presets exist but are experimental.

| Backend | Install | Run | Status |
|---------|---------|-----|--------|
| Codex | `npm install -g @openai/codex` | `voxterm` | Tested |
| Claude Code | `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh \| bash` | `voxterm --claude` | Tested |
| Gemini CLI | See vendor docs | `voxterm --gemini` | Experimental (currently not working) |
| Aider | See vendor docs | `voxterm --backend aider` | Experimental (untested) |
| OpenCode | See vendor docs | `voxterm --backend opencode` | Experimental (untested) |

### Which Whisper model should I use?

See the full [Whisper guide](WHISPER.md) for model comparison and language support.

Quick answer: Start with `base` (142 MB, fast). Use `small` or `medium` for better accuracy.

```bash
voxterm --whisper-model base
```

### Can I use VoxTerm without Codex?

Yes. Use Claude Code:
```bash
voxterm --claude
```

### Does VoxTerm send my voice to the cloud?

No. All speech-to-text happens locally via Whisper. Your audio never leaves your machine.

### How do I update VoxTerm?

**Homebrew:**
```bash
brew update && brew upgrade voxterm
```

**From source:**
```bash
cd voxterm && git pull && ./scripts/install.sh
```
