# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here, following the SDLC policy defined in `agents.md`.

## [Unreleased]

### Simplified Install Flow (2026-01-23) - COMPLETE
- **New installer**: added `install.sh` plus `scripts/setup.sh install` to download the Whisper model, build the Rust overlay, and install a `codex-voice` wrapper.
- **Overlay-first defaults**: `scripts/setup.sh` now defaults to `install` so it no longer builds the TypeScript CLI unless requested.
- **Docs updated**: README + QUICK_START now point to `./install.sh` and `codex-voice` for the simplest path.

### Homebrew Runtime Fixes (2026-01-23) - COMPLETE
- **Prebuilt overlay reuse**: `start.sh` now uses `codex-overlay` from PATH when available, skipping builds in Homebrew installs.
- **User-writable model storage**: model downloads fall back to `~/.local/share/codex-voice/models` when the repo/libexec is not writable.
- **Install wrapper safety**: skip existing global `codex-voice` commands and prefer safe locations unless overridden.

### Rust Overlay Mode + Packaging (2026-01-22) - COMPLETE
- **Added Rust overlay mode**: new `codex_overlay` binary runs Codex in a PTY, forwards raw ANSI output, and injects voice transcripts as keystrokes.
- **Prompt-aware auto-voice**: prompt detection with idle fallback plus configurable regex overrides for auto-voice triggering.
- **Serialized output writer**: PTY output + status line rendering go through a single writer thread to avoid terminal corruption.
- **PTY passthrough improvements**: new raw PTY session that answers DSR/DA queries without stripping ANSI.
- **Resizing support**: SIGWINCH handling updates PTY size and keeps the overlay stable.
- **Startup/launcher updates**: `start.sh` now defaults to overlay, ensures a Whisper model exists, and passes `--whisper-model-path`; macOS app launcher now uses overlay mode.
- **Docs refresh**: new `ARCHITECTURE.md` with detailed Rust-only diagrams and flows; README expanded with install paths, commands, and Homebrew instructions.
- **Repo hygiene**: `docs/architecture`, `docs/archive`, and `docs/references` are now ignored by git and removed from the tracked set.

### Project Cleanup + macOS Launcher (2026-01-11) - COMPLETE
- **Added macOS app launcher**: `Codex Voice.app` now in repo alongside `start.sh` and `start.bat` for cross-platform consistency.
- **Major project structure cleanup**:
  - Removed duplicate files from `rust_tui/` (CHANGELOG, docs/, screenshots, etc.)
  - Moved rust_tui test scripts to `rust_tui/scripts/`
  - Consolidated scripts: deleted redundant launchers (`run_tui.sh`, `launch_tui.py`, `run_in_pty.py`, `ts_cli/run.sh`)
  - Moved benchmark scripts to `scripts/tests/`
  - Deleted legacy folders (`stubs/`, `tst/`)
  - Kept `codex_voice.py` as legacy Python fallback
- **Updated all README diagrams** to match actual project structure.
- **Updated .gitignore** to exclude internal dev docs (`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`, `agents.md`, etc.)
- **Fixed Cargo.toml** reference to deleted test file.
- **82 Rust tests passing**, TypeScript builds successfully.

### PTY Readiness + Auth Flow (2026-01-11) - COMPLETE
- **PTY readiness handshake**: wait for initial output and fail fast when only control output appears, preventing 20-30s stalls on persistent sessions.
- **/auth login flow**: new IPC command + wrapper command runs provider login via /dev/tty, with auth_start/auth_end events and raw mode suspension in TS.
- **Output delivery fix**: Codex Finished output is delivered even if the worker signal channel disconnects.
- **CI/testing updates**: added `mutation-testing.yml` and extended integration test coverage for the auth command.

### Provider-Agnostic Backend + TypeScript CLI (2026-01-10) - COMPLETE
- **Implemented provider-agnostic backend**: `rust_tui/src/ipc.rs` rewritten with non-blocking event loop, supporting both Codex and Claude CLIs with full slash-command parity.
- **TypeScript CLI functional**: `ts_cli/` contains thin wrapper with ANSI art banner, Ctrl+R voice capture, provider switching, and full IPC integration.
- **Rust IPC mode**: `--json-ipc` flag enables JSON-lines protocol with capability handshake on startup.
- **All critical bugs fixed**:
  - IPC no longer blocks during job processing (stdin reader thread)
  - Codex/Claude output streams to TypeScript
  - Ctrl+R wired for voice capture (raw mode)
  - Unknown `/` commands forwarded to provider
- **New features**:
  - Capability handshake with full system info (`capabilities` event)
  - Session-level provider switching (`/provider claude`)
  - One-off provider commands (`/codex <prompt>`, `/claude <prompt>`)
  - Setup script for Whisper model download (`scripts/setup.sh`)
- **Test coverage**:
  - 18 unit tests for provider routing and IPC protocol
  - 12 integration tests for end-to-end flow
  - All tests passing

### CRITICAL - Phase 2B Design Correction (2025-11-13 Evening)
- **Rejected original Phase 2B "chunked Whisper" proposal (Option A)** after identifying fatal architectural flaw: sequential chunk transcription provides NO latency improvement (capture + Σchunks often slower than capture + single_batch). Original proposal would have wasted weeks implementing slower approach.
- **Documented corrected design** in `docs/architecture/2025-11-13/PHASE_2B_CORRECTED_DESIGN.md` specifying streaming mel + Whisper FFI architecture (Option B) as only viable path to <750ms voice latency target. User confirmed requirement: "we need to do option 2 i want it to be responsive not slow".
- **Design includes:** Three-worker parallel architecture (capture/mel/stt), streaming Whisper FFI wrapper, fallback ladder (streaming→batch→Python), comprehensive measurement gates, 5-6 week implementation plan, and mandatory approval gates before any coding begins.
- **Measurement gate executed:** Recorded 10 end-to-end Ctrl+R→Codex runs (short/medium commands) and captured results in `docs/architecture/2025-11-13/LATENCY_MEASUREMENTS.md`. Voice pipeline averages 1.19 s, Codex averages 9.2 s (≈88 % of total latency), so Phase 2B remains blocked until Codex latency is addressed or stakeholders explicitly accept the limited ROI.
- **Codex remediation plan:** Authored `docs/architecture/2025-11-13/CODEX_LATENCY_PLAN.md` covering telemetry upgrades, PTY/CLI health checks, CLI profiling, and alternative backend options. Phase 2B remains gated on executing this plan and obtaining stakeholder approval.
- **Persistent PTY fix:** Health check now waits 5 s and only verifies the child process is alive (no synthetic prompts), so conversations start clean and persistent sessions stay responsive. Python helper path was removed; persistent mode is pure Rust. Next Codex task is streaming output so the UI shows tokens as they arrive.
- **Next steps:** (1) Address Codex latency or approve proceeding despite the bottleneck, (2) Decide between local streaming (Option B) vs. cloud STT vs. deferral, (3) Confirm complexity budget (5–6 weeks acceptable), (4) Only after approvals resume Phase 2B work.

### Added
- Completed the Phase 2A recorder work: `FrameAccumulator` maintains bounded frame buffers with lookback-aware trimming, `CaptureMetrics` now report `capture_ms`, and perf smoke parses the real `voice_metrics|…` log lines emitted by `voice.rs`.
- Added `CaptureState` helpers plus unit tests covering max-duration timeout, min-speech gating, and manual stop semantics so recorder edge cases stay regression-tested.
- Phase 2A scaffolding: introduced the `VadEngine` trait, Earshot feature gating, and a fallback energy-based VAD so recorder callers can swap implementations without API churn.
- Runtime-selectable VADs: new `--voice-vad-engine <earshot|simple>` flag (documented in `docs/references/quick_start.md`), validation, and `VoicePipelineConfig` plumbing so operators can pick Earshot (default when the feature is built) or the lightweight threshold fallback without touching source code.
- Added the `vad_earshot` optional dependency/feature wiring in `Cargo.toml` together with the new `rust_tui/src/vad_earshot.rs` adapter.
- Updated the voice pipeline to call `Recorder::record_with_vad`, log per-utterance metrics, and honor the latency plan’s logging/backpressure rules.
- Introduced the async Codex worker module (`rust_tui/src/codex.rs`) plus the supporting test-only job hook harness so Codex calls can run off the UI thread and remain unit-testable without shelling out.
- Documented the approved Phase 1 backend plan (“Option 2.5” event-stream refactor) in `docs/architecture/2025-11-13/ARCHITECTURE.md`, capturing the Wrapper Scope Correction + Instruction blocks required before touching Codex integration.
- Added perf/memory guard rails: `app::tests::{perf_smoke_emits_timing_log,memory_guard_backend_threads_drop}` together with `.github/workflows/perf_smoke.yml` and `.github/workflows/memory_guard.yml` so CI enforces telemetry output and backend thread cleanup.
- Implemented the Phase 1 backend refactor: `CodexBackend`/`BackendJob` abstractions with bounded queues, `CliBackend` PTY ownership, App wiring to backend events, and new queue/tests (`cargo test --no-default-features`).
- Benchmark harness for Phase 2A: `audio::offline_capture_from_pcm`, the `voice_benchmark` binary, `scripts/benchmark_voice.sh`, and `docs/architecture/2025-11-13/BENCHMARKS.md` capture deterministic short/medium/long clip metrics that feed the capture_ms SLA.

### Changed
- Replaced the `Recorder::record_with_vad` stub (non-test builds) with the new chunked capture loop (bounded channel + VAD decisions + metrics) ahead of the perf_smoke gate.
- `App`/`ui` now spawn Codex work asynchronously, render a spinner with Esc/Ctrl+C cancellation, and log `timing|phase=codex_job|...` metrics; `cargo test --no-default-features` gates the new worker while the `earshot` crate remains offline.
- Corrected the Earshot profile mapping (`rust_tui/src/vad_earshot.rs`) and fixed the Rubato `SincFixedIn` construction (`rust_tui/src/audio.rs`) so the high-quality resampler runs cleanly instead of spamming “expected 256 channels” and falling back on every frame.
- Introduced an explicit redraw flag in `App` plus a simplified `ui.rs` loop so job completions and spinner ticks refresh the TUI automatically; recordings/transcripts now appear without requiring stray keypresses while still capping idle redraws.
- Tightened the persistent Codex PTY timeout (2 s to first printable output, 10 s overall) so we fall back to the CLI path quickly when the helper is silent, eliminating the 30–45 s per-request stall.
- Resolved the remaining clippy warnings by introducing `JobContext`, simplifying queue errors, modernizing format strings, and gating unused imports; `cargo clippy --no-default-features` now runs clean.

### Fixed
- Restored the missing atomic `Ordering` import under all feature combinations (`rust_tui/src/audio.rs`) and removed the redundant crate-level cfg guard from `rust_tui/src/vad_earshot.rs`, unblocking `cargo clippy --all-features` and `cargo test --no-default-features`.
- Codex backend module once again satisfies `cargo fmt`: moved the `#[cfg(test)]` attribute ahead of the gated `AtomicUsize` import (`rust_tui/src/codex.rs`) to follow Rust formatting rules.
- GitHub Actions Linux runners now install ALSA headers before running our audio-heavy tests (`.github/workflows/perf_smoke.yml`, `.github/workflows/memory_guard.yml`), fixing the `alsa-sys` build failures on CI.
- `voice_benchmark` now validates `--voice-vad-engine earshot` against the `vad_earshot` feature via the new `ensure_vad_engine_supported` helper plus clap-based unit tests, preventing the `unreachable!()` panic the reviewer observed when the benchmark binary is compiled without the feature flag.

### Known Issues
- `cargo check`/`test` cannot download the `earshot` crate in this environment; run the builds once network access is available to validate the new code paths.

## [2025-11-12]
### Added
- Established baseline governance artifacts: `master_index.md`, repository `CHANGELOG.md`, root `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` (planned updates), and the initial dated architecture folder under `docs/architecture/`.
- Consolidated legacy documentation into the daily architecture tree (`docs/architecture/YYYY-MM-DD/`), `docs/references/` (formerly `docs/guides/`), and `docs/audits/`; backfilled the original architecture overview into `docs/architecture/2025-11-11/`.
- Relocated root-level guides (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `MASTER_DOC.md`, `plan.md`) into `docs/references/`, corrected the historical architecture baseline to `docs/architecture/2025-11-11/`, and updated navigation pointers accordingly.
- Updated the new references (`quick_start.md`, `testing.md`, `python_legacy.md`) to reflect the current Rust pipeline (Ctrl+R voice key, `cargo run` workflow, native audio tests) and annotated the legacy plan in `docs/archive/MVP_PLAN_2024.md`.
- Added a concise root `README.md`, introduced the “You Are Here” section in `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`, renamed `docs/guides/` → `docs/references/` (`quick_start.md`, `testing.md`, `python_legacy.md`, `milestones.md`, `troubleshooting.md`), and archived superseded guides under `docs/archive/OBSOLETE_GUIDES_2025-11-12/`.
- Updated helper scripts (`rust_tui/test_performance.sh`, `test_voice.sh`, `simple_test.sh`, `final_test.sh`) to rely on `cargo run`, Ctrl+R instructions, and the shared `${TMPDIR}/codex_voice_tui.log`.
- Extended `agents.md` with an end-of-session checklist so every workday records architecture notes, changelog entries, and the “You Are Here” pointer.
- Consolidated the CI/CD references into a single `docs/references/cicd_plan.md`, merging the previous implementation + dependency guides and archiving the superseded files under `docs/archive/OBSOLETE_REFERENCES_2025-11-12/`.
- Expanded `docs/references/cicd_plan.md` with appendices covering phase-by-phase scripts, tooling/dependency matrices, rollback/cost controls, and troubleshooting so it fully supersedes the archived references.
- Captured the latency remediation plan in `docs/audits/latency_remediation_plan_2025-11-12.md` and updated `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` to prioritize latency stabilization workstreams ahead of module decomposition and CI enhancements.
- Strengthened the latency plan with explicit Phase 2A/2B/3 naming, backpressure/frame/shutdown/fallback policies, and structured tracing + CI perf gate requirements so phase execution is unambiguous.
- Added production-grade detail to the latency plan: failure hierarchy, VAD safety rails, bounded resource budgets, observability schema, CI enforcement hooks, and a 15-day execution timeline.
- Updated `agents.md` so the latency requirements explicitly point to the Phase 2B specification (`docs/audits/latency_remediation_plan_2025-11-12.md`) and mandate adherence to the new resource/observability/CI rules.
- Documented the state machine, config/deployment profiles, and concurrency guardrails inside the latency plan so downstream work follows the same lifecycle semantics.
- Hardened `agents.md` with Scope/Non-goals, "Before You Start" instructions, condensed voice requirements referencing the latency plan, explicit doc-update rules, and a prominent end-of-session checklist.
- Recorded the readiness audit (`docs/audits/READINESS_AUDIT_2025-11-12.md`), summarized its findings in the architecture log, and captured the Phase 2A design (Earshot VAD, config surface, metrics, exit criteria) plus the immediate task list (perf_smoke CI, Python feature flag, module decomposition planning).
