# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here, following the SDLC policy defined in `agents.md`.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Phase 2A scaffolding: introduced the `VadEngine` trait, Earshot feature gating, and a fallback energy-based VAD so recorder callers can swap implementations without API churn.
- Added the `vad_earshot` optional dependency/feature wiring in `Cargo.toml` together with the new `rust_tui/src/vad_earshot.rs` adapter.
- Updated the voice pipeline to call `Recorder::record_with_vad`, log per-utterance metrics, and honor the latency plan’s logging/backpressure rules.
- Introduced the async Codex worker module (`rust_tui/src/codex.rs`) plus the supporting test-only job hook harness so Codex calls can run off the UI thread and remain unit-testable without shelling out.
- Documented the approved Phase 1 backend plan (“Option 2.5” event-stream refactor) in `docs/architecture/2025-11-13/ARCHITECTURE.md`, capturing the Wrapper Scope Correction + Instruction blocks required before touching Codex integration.
- Added perf/memory guard rails: `app::tests::{perf_smoke_emits_timing_log,memory_guard_backend_threads_drop}` together with `.github/workflows/perf_smoke.yml` and `.github/workflows/memory_guard.yml` so CI enforces telemetry output and backend thread cleanup.
- Implemented the Phase 1 backend refactor: `CodexBackend`/`BackendJob` abstractions with bounded queues, `CliBackend` PTY ownership, App wiring to backend events, and new queue/tests (`cargo test --no-default-features`).

### Changed
- Replaced the `Recorder::record_with_vad` stub (non-test builds) with the new chunked capture loop (bounded channel + VAD decisions + metrics) ahead of the perf_smoke gate.
- `App`/`ui` now spawn Codex work asynchronously, render a spinner with Esc/Ctrl+C cancellation, and log `timing|phase=codex_job|...` metrics; `cargo test --no-default-features` gates the new worker while the `earshot` crate remains offline.
- Corrected the Earshot profile mapping (`rust_tui/src/vad_earshot.rs`) and fixed the Rubato `SincFixedIn` construction (`rust_tui/src/audio.rs`) so the high-quality resampler runs cleanly instead of spamming “expected 256 channels” and falling back on every frame.
- Introduced an explicit redraw flag in `App` plus a simplified `ui.rs` loop so job completions and spinner ticks refresh the TUI automatically; recordings/transcripts now appear without requiring stray keypresses while still capping idle redraws.
- Tightened the persistent Codex PTY timeout (2 s to first printable output, 10 s overall) so we fall back to the CLI path quickly when the helper is silent, eliminating the 30–45 s per-request stall.
- Resolved the remaining clippy warnings by introducing `JobContext`, simplifying queue errors, modernizing format strings, and gating unused imports; `cargo clippy --no-default-features` now runs clean.

### Fixed
- Restored the missing atomic `Ordering` import under all feature combinations (`rust_tui/src/audio.rs`) and removed the redundant crate-level cfg guard from `rust_tui/src/vad_earshot.rs`, unblocking `cargo clippy --all-features` and `cargo test --no-default-features`.
- Codex backend module once again satisfies `cargo fmt`: moved the `#[cfg(test)]` attribute ahead of the gated `AtomicUsize` import (`rust_tui/src/codex.rs`) to follow Rust formatting rules.
- GitHub Actions Linux runners now install ALSA headers before running our audio-heavy tests (`.github/workflows/perf_smoke.yml`, `.github/workflows/memory_guard.yml`), fixing the `alsa-sys` build failures on CI.

### Known Issues
- `cargo check`/`test` cannot download the `earshot` crate in this environment; run the builds once network access is available to validate the new code paths.

## [2025-11-12]
### Added
- Established baseline governance artifacts: `master_index.md`, repository `CHANGELOG.md`, root `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` (planned updates), and the initial dated architecture folder under `docs/architecture/`.
- Consolidated legacy documentation into the daily architecture tree (`docs/architecture/YYYY-MM-DD/`), `docs/references/` (formerly `docs/guides/`), and `docs/audits/`; backfilled the original architecture overview into `docs/architecture/2025-11-11/`.
- Relocated root-level guides (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `MASTER_DOC.md`, `plan.md`) into `docs/references/`, corrected the historical architecture baseline to `docs/architecture/2025-11-11/`, and updated navigation pointers accordingly.
- Updated the new references (`quick_start.md`, `testing.md`, `python_legacy.md`) to reflect the current Rust pipeline (Ctrl+R voice key, `cargo run` workflow, native audio tests) and annotated the legacy plan in `docs/archive/MVP_PLAN_2024.md`.
- Added a concise root `README.md`, introduced the “You Are Here” section in `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`, renamed `docs/guides/` → `docs/references/` (`quick_start.md`, `testing.md`, `python_legacy.md`, `milestones.md`, `troubleshooting.md`), and archived superseded guides under `docs/archive/OBSOLETE_GUIDES_2025-11-12/`.
- Updated helper scripts (`rust_tui/test_performance.sh`, `test_voice.sh`, `simple_test.sh`, `final_test.sh`) to rely on `cargo run`, Ctrl+R instructions, and the shared `${TMPDIR}/codex_voice_tui.log`.
- Extended `agents.md` with an end-of-session checklist so every workday records architecture notes, changelog entries, and the “You Are Here” pointer.
- Consolidated the CI/CD references into a single `docs/references/cicd_plan.md`, merging the previous implementation + dependency guides and archiving the superseded files under `docs/archive/OBSOLETE_REFERENCES_2025-11-12/`.
- Expanded `docs/references/cicd_plan.md` with appendices covering phase-by-phase scripts, tooling/dependency matrices, rollback/cost controls, and troubleshooting so it fully supersedes the archived references.
- Captured the latency remediation plan in `docs/audits/latency_remediation_plan_2025-11-12.md` and updated `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` to prioritize latency stabilization workstreams ahead of module decomposition and CI enhancements.
- Strengthened the latency plan with explicit Phase 2A/2B/3 naming, backpressure/frame/shutdown/fallback policies, and structured tracing + CI perf gate requirements so phase execution is unambiguous.
- Added production-grade detail to the latency plan: failure hierarchy, VAD safety rails, bounded resource budgets, observability schema, CI enforcement hooks, and a 15-day execution timeline.
- Updated `agents.md` so the latency requirements explicitly point to the Phase 2B specification (`docs/audits/latency_remediation_plan_2025-11-12.md`) and mandate adherence to the new resource/observability/CI rules.
- Documented the state machine, config/deployment profiles, and concurrency guardrails inside the latency plan so downstream work follows the same lifecycle semantics.
- Hardened `agents.md` with Scope/Non-goals, "Before You Start" instructions, condensed voice requirements referencing the latency plan, explicit doc-update rules, and a prominent end-of-session checklist.
- Recorded the readiness audit (`docs/audits/READINESS_AUDIT_2025-11-12.md`), summarized its findings in the architecture log, and captured the Phase 2A design (Earshot VAD, config surface, metrics, exit criteria) plus the immediate task list (perf_smoke CI, Python feature flag, module decomposition planning).
