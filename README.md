Voice input for the Codex CLI by default, with optional backend selection for other AI CLIs. Written in Rust for speed. Talk instead of type and boost your productivity. Runs Whisper locally through Rust with ~250ms latency. No cloud, no API keys.

## What VoxTerm Does

Wraps Codex (or another AI CLI via `--backend`) in a PTY and adds voice input. You talk → Whisper transcribes → text gets typed into the CLI. VoxTerm runs over the native CLI, so you keep its features like file editing and code generation.

- Written in Rust for speed
- Local speech-to-text via whisper.cpp
- ~250ms transcription time
- No network calls
- PTY overlay - CLI UI unchanged

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux (Windows needs WSL2)
- Node.js (for Codex CLI) or another supported AI CLI if using `--backend`
- Microphone access
- ~1.5 GB disk for Whisper model

## Install

```bash
# Install Codex CLI first (default backend)
npm install -g @openai/codex

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/jguida941/voxterm.git
cd voxterm
./install.sh

# Run it
cd ~/your-project
voxterm
```

First run downloads the Whisper model.

To target another AI CLI instead of Codex, pass `--backend` (example: `voxterm --backend claude`).

**Other options:** [Homebrew](docs/INSTALL.md#homebrew) | [macOS App](docs/INSTALL.md#macos-app) | [Build from source](docs/INSTALL.md#from-source)

## Controls

| Key | What it does |
|-----|--------------|
| `Ctrl+R` | Record voice |
| `Ctrl+V` | Toggle auto-voice (hands-free mode) |
| `Ctrl+T` | Toggle auto-send vs manual send |
| `Ctrl+Y` | Theme picker |
| `Ctrl+O` | Settings menu |
| `Ctrl+]` | Mic sensitivity up |
| `Ctrl+\` | Mic sensitivity down (also `Ctrl+/`) |
| `?` | Show shortcut help |
| `Enter` | Stop recording early (insert mode) / send prompt |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Quit |
| `Ctrl+C` | Send interrupt to CLI |

## Features

- **Local STT:** Whisper runs on your local machine
- **PTY passthrough:** Integrates with the selected CLI seamlessly
- **Auto-voice:** Code hands-free, no typing needed
- **Transcript queue:** Speak while the CLI is busy, transcripts send when ready
- **No logging by default:** Enable with `--logs` if you need it

## macOS App

Double-click `VoxTerm.app`, pick a folder, it opens Terminal with voxterm running.

## How It Works

```
Mic → Whisper → Text → PTY → CLI
                         ↓
                     Terminal (raw output)
```

The CLI runs in a PTY. Voice transcripts are sent as keystrokes. All CLI output passes through unchanged.
