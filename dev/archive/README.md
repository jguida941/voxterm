# Archive

This folder stores completed work items pulled from the active master plan.

## How to use
- When work is completed, add a dated entry file here (YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.md).
- Include a brief summary and the completed checklist items.
- Link back to the source doc(s) when helpful (audit, review, issue, PR).
- Keep the master plan current by removing completed items and linking the archive entry.
