# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs capture the "why" behind key technical decisions so we can revisit them later
without re-litigating old context. Keep them short, factual, and specific.

## Location
- Store ADRs in this folder: `dev/adr/`

## Naming
- `NNNN-short-title.md` (4-digit, zero-padded)
- Example: `0015-new-feature-decision.md`

## Template
- Start from [0000-template.md](0000-template.md)

## Statuses
- **Proposed** - Under discussion
- **Accepted** - Decision made and implemented
- **Deprecated** - No longer applies
- **Superseded** - Replaced by another ADR (link to replacement)

## Process

1. Copy the template and increment the number (next: 0023)
2. Fill in Context, Decision, and Consequences
3. Add links to related docs or code
4. Update this index

## When to Write an ADR

Write an ADR when:
- Making a decision that affects multiple modules
- Choosing between multiple valid approaches
- Implementing something that future maintainers might question
- Making a trade-off (performance vs simplicity, security vs convenience, etc.)
- Changing an existing architectural decision

Don't write an ADR for:
- Bug fixes
- Minor refactoring
- Single-module implementation details
- Decisions already documented elsewhere
